	<p>After-school tutoring programs play a crucial role in improving educational outcomes, promoting equity in education, and helping students reach their full potential academically and personally. <b>These are main factors in opting for online tutoring. </b></p>
  <div class="row">

			<h2 style="text-align: center">Tutor with Competitors</h2>
			<div><strong>Cost:</strong> Apparently, the cost of a tutor is the greatest concern that stops many parents, either middle or low income, from affording help for their children to improve their grades. Most centers charge anywhere from $50 to $120 per hour. With an average of three sessions per week, it costs $600 to $1440 per month, which is out of reach for many families. <font size="2em">*The provided rate is a sample for a Math tutor.</font></div>
			<div><strong>Time Spent:</strong> According to research from <a href="https://annenberg.brown.edu/sites/default/files/EdResearch_for_Recovery_Design_Principles_1.pdf">Brown University</a> tutoring is most likely to be effective when delivered in high doses through tutoring programs with three or more sessions per week. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, many students have limited hours or none at all.  Parents aim to maximize their child's learning time while also limiting the cost factors. </div>
			<div><strong>Effort:</strong> In-person tutoring can be highly beneficial for students, but it also comes with some challenges, particularly in terms of driving time. Driving to and from tutoring sessions can consume a significant amount of time, especially for families with busy schedules. This can be challenging for both students and parents, as it may conflict with other commitments and activities.</div>
			<div><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Scheduling with the right expert for a student's situation at the tutor center can sometimes present challenges due to various factors. Tutor centers often have limited availability, especially during peak times such as exam periods or after-school hours. Some centers may have rigid operating hours that don't align with a student's schedule or availability. Fixed session durations may not align with a student's learning pace, as some students may require longer or shorter sessions.</div>

			<div style="color: white"><strong style="color: #e6bc20">Cost:</strong> Our primary objective is to make tutoring available to everyone, so cost will not be a determining factor when deciding on tutoring.

			<div style="color: white"><strong style="color: #e6bc20">Time Spent:</strong> Since cost is not a concern, students can maximize the time they need with a tutor to improve their academics. </div>
			<div style="color: white"><strong style="color: #e6bc20">Effort:</strong> Online tutoring allows students to access educational support from the comfort of their own homes or any location with internet access. This eliminates the need for commuting and saves time for both students and parents.</div>
			<div style="color: white"><strong style="color: #e6bc20">Flexibility:</strong> Our experts are not based in one central location, which means we have a large pool of the right tutors to match your needs and schedule.</div>
